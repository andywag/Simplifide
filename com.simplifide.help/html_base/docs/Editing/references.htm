<p>The product currently supports a feature which can find all of the references to an object in the design. We are 
actively working on adding other searches like fan-in, fan-out, and others. The references menu can be enabled by 
selecting the object to search with the cursor and right clicking which will open up the popup menu shown below. </p>

<p>After selecting the references, a search window will open up at the bottom of the page which will contain all of the 
 references to the object. Double clicking on the object will open up the editor to the proper location. </p>
