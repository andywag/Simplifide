<!--*** <h1>Refactoring</h1> ***-->

<p>We are actively working on adding other refactorings, but currently we support the most important <b>Renaming</b>.
 This refactoring will rename an object in all of the places which it is used. This method currently works on all 
 supported constructs with the exceptions of functions. 
</p>

<p>To rename an element, select the object with the cursor and right click to select the refactor->rename menu shown below.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../images/editting/refactor_popup.jpg"/></p>

<p>Put the new name into the dialog page, and enter select to accept the refactoring or hit next to examine the specific
 changes which will be made. We strongly recommend examining the changes for complicated changes. </p>

 <p>If you choose next a dialog will open up which shows all of the corresponding changes which will be made. At 
  this point you can choose whether you actually want to make the change.</p>
