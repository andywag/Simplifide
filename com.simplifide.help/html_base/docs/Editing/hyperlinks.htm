<!--*** <h1>Advanced Navigation Features</h1> ***-->


<p>One of the key advantages of this tool is it's ability to automatically move the cursor to the place where an 
 object is defined with a simple mouse click (actually a CTRL+click). This alleviates the need to search through the code
 to find where the object is defined. </p>
	 
<p>There are two different ways to navigate through the code.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Hyperlinks</li>
	<li>Editor Menu Operation</li>
</ul>
	 
<h2>Hyperlinks</h2>
<p>Typing the Ctrl key will bring up a hand icon over places where hyperlinks 
are supported. </p>

<p>Clicking the mouse button will then open the file and move the cursor to the 
position where this is defined. </p>
<p>

<h2>Editor Menu Operation</h2>
<p>The editor menu operation is similar to the hyperlinks except it gives more options for places to go. 
This is important for objects like entities which can potentially point to a component and additionally an architecture as well
