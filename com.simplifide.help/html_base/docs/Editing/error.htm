<!--*** <h1>Error Highlighting</h1> ***-->

<p>The plugin supports syntax error highlighting along with a small set of other errors and warnings 
which can be used to help check your design before going through the compile or synthesis process. Many other 
errors and warnings are currently being worked on. The window below shows a list of errors which can be configurated at
<strong>Window-&gt;Preferences-&gt;SimplifIDE-&gt;Vhdl-&gt;Error</strong>.</p>
<p>Most of the errors/warnings are labeled as alpha.
This is mainly due to certain constructs not being fully supported. If your design contains these constructs the errors can
be disabled so the messages don't become a distraction.</p>
