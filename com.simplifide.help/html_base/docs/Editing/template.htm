<p>Templates are commonly typed expressions which can be compressed into 
abbreviations to save typing. There are a set of templates which are distributed 
with the plugin and a preference page where user defined templates can be added. 
The operation for templates are similar to code completion where Ctrl+Space 
opens up the menus to select the templates. </p>

and the parameterized entries can be selected by entering the appropriate text 
and pressing tab to scroll between objects. </p>
