<!--*** <h1>Resource Linking</h1> ***-->

	<p>Eclipse is architected to only support files which are in subdirectories of the workspace (the startup folder). This can
	be inconvenient for many different types of projects and usages escpecially in large chip developments. This limitation can be 
	overcome by using links which are very similar to symbol links on Unix/Linux systems. This link makes the folder or file appear as if it 
	is directly linked to the position thus allowing it to work normally.</p>
	
	<h2>Creating a Symbolic Link</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Right click on any folder in the workspace</li>
		<li>From the menu select New-&gt;Other<p><img alt="" src="../images/gettingstarted/wizard_new_resource.png" width="492" height="355" />
		</p>
		</li>
		<li>Choose either file or folder depending on the type of link you are interested in<p><img alt=""src="../images/gettingstarted/wizard_resource_advanced.png" /></p></li>
		<li>Push the advanced button and select <strong>Link to file in the file system</strong></li>
		<li>Push the browse button and select the desired file and you have linked the file</li>
</ol>
