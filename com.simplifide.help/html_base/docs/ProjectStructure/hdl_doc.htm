<!--*** <h1>HDLdoc</h1> ***-->
<p>HDLdoc is similar to javadoc where the comments before object declarations are parsed and added
   associated with the object for documentation purposes. Currently this form of documentation is being
   used for <a href="../Editing/texthovers.htm"/>text hovers</a>, but in the very near term this will
   be expanded to aid in generating design documentation.  </p>

<h2>HdlDoc Syntax</h2>
<p>The syntax for the hdl doc is quite straightforward, and can probably best be seen by looking at the 
   example project supplied with this software. In general the format follows these rules : </p>

<ul>
	<li>All doc lines are prefixed with a --* </li>
	<li>A general description of the object is first followed by extra descriptors</li>
	<li>The extra descriptors all follow the format of <b>@{name}</b> <i>@{value}</i> <b>@{description}</b> where the value is optional in some cases</li>
	<li>A small subset of html is allowed inside the description blocks which include bold, italic, and color tags</li>
</ul>

<h2>Current Descriptors</h2>

<p>Below is a list of the currently implemented descriptors. This is an initial version and descriptors will
 be added with time, but efforts will be made to keep the syntax backward compatible.</p> 
  
<ul>
	<li><b>@port</b>   {port_name} {port_description} is used to describe ports</li>
	<li><b>@param</b>  {param_name} {param_description} is used to describe parameters mainly used for types</li>
	<li><b>@return</b> {return_name} {return_description} is used to describe the return value for functions</li>
	<li><b>@latch</b> is used to describe a latched process so it is not flagged as a warning</li>
	<li><b>@deprecated</b> {description} is used to describe an object which should no longer be used</li>
</ul>
