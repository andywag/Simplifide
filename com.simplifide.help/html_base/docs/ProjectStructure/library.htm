<!--*** <h1>Library</h1> ***-->
<p>A library is a fixed set of code which is not directly part of the design but is used in the design. An example of this 
	is the ieee library for vhdl. The library has the following set of 
requirements</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>A library must consist of a static set of Files.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Libraries are treated in a similar fashion to projects except for a few differences important to the performance of the
plugin</p>
<ul>
	<li>Files in the library directory are only compiled when used by files in the project directory. </li>
	<li>Library files are only compiled initially when the design is loaded.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Speeding Up Library Load Time (Alpha) </h2>

In general history is intentionally not stored between different "runs" or "cleans" of the project. For the cases of
libraries which are static there is the option to store the information from the last run. This is highly recommended
for performance of the plugin. To enable this check the box for <b>Enable Storage of Library Contents</b>

<h2>Creating New Library</h2>
<p>Creation of a new library follows the same steps as creating a new project. 
Right click on the libraries folder and&nbsp; select <strong>New-&gt;Hardware
