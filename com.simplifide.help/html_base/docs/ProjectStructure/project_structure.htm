<!--*** <h1>Project Structure</h1> ***-->

		<p>Many of the features of this tool require knowledge of the project structure. While this is true, 
	we are aware that people already have in general created an infrastructure and environment around their 
	source files which makes the most sense for their design flow. The goal of this structure is to be completely 
	independent of the operating structure and easy to setup/install. For this reason eclipse and this tool have a 
	concept of symbolic links to make attaching this tool to your project as simple as possible. Setting up a project 
	structure for your design is not required for basic editing but is required for most of the features of this tool.</p>
	<p>The project structure consists of 4 basic entities for the design portion. There is room to expand upon these entities for embedded scripting support and documentation generation which are future features of this tool. </p>

		<h2>Project Building</h2>
		<p>Most of the project operations are handled by intelligent background 
		compile operations. For performance reasons and potentially due to bugs 
		this does not always work properly. </p>
		<ol>
			<li>For correct operation of this project the <strong>Project-&gt;Build 
			Automatically</strong> needs to be enabled</li>
			<li>If a complex operation is performed, and the workspace doesn&#39;t 
			seem correct, the first step should be to attempt a recompile
			<strong>Project-&gt;Clean</strong></li>
