<p>External tools can be hooked up to the editor to display errors and other information inside the editor screen. 
This operation is performed every time a file is saved.
Currently there is only support for ModelSim, but other simulators and tools will be added shortly. The support of integration
of external tools is based on python (actually jython) and will in the long term be very configurable, but the API is not stable
and so at this time it is strongly recommended to use this as is.  </p>
<p><b>This feature requires 1.0.68 or greater</b></p>

<h2>Enabling Support for ModelSim</h2>

<p>Simulator integration is handled by a python file (Interface.py) in the script directory of the hardware suite. For 
an existing project copy <a href = "Interface.py">Interface.py</a> to this location. The plugin knows the structure of the 
design so there is no additional work to set this up. </p>

<p>For example projects this is automatically included and for new projects this is part of the wizard shown below</p>
