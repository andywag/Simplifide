<!--*** <h1>Introduction</h1> ***-->

	</p>
	<h2>Updates</h2>
	<p>This tool is a work in progress, which contains a set of features which are stable and some advanced optional features which are not as stable. It is highly recommended that you update the software often to get access to the latest features along with bug fixes. The tool contains an easy to use update features to facilitate this process. </p>
	<h2>Getting Started</h2>
	<p>
	For 
	the majority of hardware designers who are not used to using advanced IDE 
	environments, and even those who are not used to using eclipse operating 
	with this environment is slightly different. It is highly recommended that 
	you read the short documentation related to the
	<a href="../ProjectStructure/project_structure.htm">
	project operations</a>, and the
	<a href="../GettingStarted/getting_started.htm">getting 
	started</a> sections. An attempt has been made to make things as simple as 
	possible, but reading these sections can save a lot of time.</p>

	<p> For the hardcore emacs users, here are instructions to use the same command keys as emacs. </p>
