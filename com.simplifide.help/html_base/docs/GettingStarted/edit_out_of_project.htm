	<p>While the majority of advantages of this plugin come from the project oriented features. There
	are always times when you may just simply want to edit a file. One of the drawbacks of
	the eclipse platform is that it doesn't support files outside of the workspace well. This can be overcome
	by using the <a href="../ProjectStructure/resource_linking.htm">resource linking</a> feature of eclipse.</p>
	
	<p>In general linking individual files can be a time consuming process, for that reason the following approach
	is recommended.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Create a new project by using the menu <b>File->New->Project</b> and selecting <b>General/Project</b>
		<p><img alt="" src="../images/gettingstarted/edit_new_project.jpg"  /></p>
		</li>
		<li>Follow the instructions in <a href="../ProjectStructure/resource_linking.htm">resource linking</a> to link 
		the root folder of all of your design files. In this way, you can use this method to navigate this path 
		and easily edit your files. 
		</li>
	</ol>
