Technical content:
 
		Title: 		Test for vmm_group 
 
		Objective:    To illustrate phasing execution for vmm_group based componenents.

		Description:  This test shows the usage of vmm_group as the root component  and how its methods gets phased for execution.

		Additional setup: None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
